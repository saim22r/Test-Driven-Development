# Test Driven Development
- Write a unit test that fails
- Write production code that passes the test
- Refactor/Clean the code and eliminate redundancies

1. Create a new repo called python_TDD
2. Create a new project on pycharm with the same name
3. Create a test file called calc_test.py (Naming convention is essential)
4. Create a file called simple_calc.py to write code to pass the tests

- `pip install pytest`
- We will use `unittest` and `pytest`
